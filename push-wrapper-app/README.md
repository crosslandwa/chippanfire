# Push Wrapper example

This folder contains the bundle (and slightly modified styles) built from my  [push-wrapper-example-site](https://github.com/crosslandwa/push-wrapper-example-site)

To update:
- build the js from the above link
- update `push-wrapper-example.js` with the contents of the created *bundle*
- copy over any CSS changes to `push-wrapper-exampe-styles.css`
- copy over any HTML changes into `templates/content-push-wrapper.js`
- rebuild the main site

(Yes this is tedious...)
